# **PP-YOLOE + PIoU Loss (Work in Progress)**

This repository contains **lightweight modifications** to the MMYOLO implementation of **PP-YOLOE**, introducing a new **Perceptual IoU (PIoU) loss** aimed at improving bounding box localization under partial occlusion and truncation.

⚠️ **NOTE:**
This project is **under active research and development**.
The method, experiments, and results are **preliminary** and may change as the work progresses or before an official publication.


## 📌 **Abstract (Short Summary)**

Object detectors often struggle under partial occlusion due to limitations in standard IoU-based losses.
This project introduces a **Perceptual IoU (PIoU)** loss—a corner-aware extension of IoU that enforces perceptual boundary consistency.
When integrated into PP-YOLOE, PIoU aims to improve localization stability for occluded targets.
Initial results on COCO and custom occlusion datasets show **promising improvements**, while maintaining inference efficiency.



## 🧩 **Purpose of This Repository**

This is a **patch-style repo**, containing only the **modified files and new modules**, instead of the full MMYOLO project.
It is designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate into any existing MMYOLO environment.

Contents include:

* Modified **backbone**, **neck**, and **head** components
* Newly added **PIoU loss module**
* Config files for training PP-YOLOE with PIoU
* Documentation for applying the patch

## 🔬 **Research Goal**

This project is part of an ongoing research effort exploring:

* Corner-sensitive loss functions
* Perceptual consistency for bounding boxes
* Occlusion-aware object detection
* Extensions of PP-YOLOE for challenging real-world datasets

If the project matures, it may be prepared for submission to a conference or journal.
